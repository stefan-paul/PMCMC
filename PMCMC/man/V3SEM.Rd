\description{
A very simple ecosystem model, based on three carbon pools and a basic LUE model
}
\details{
This Very Simple Ecosystem Model (VSEM) is a 'toy' model designed to be very simple but yet bear some resemblance to deterministic processed based ecosystem models (PBMs) that are commonly used in forest modelling.

The model determines the accumulation of carbon in the plant and soil from the growth of the plant via photosynthesis and senescence to the soil which respires carbon back to the atmosphere.

The model calculates Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using a very simple light-use efficiency (LUE) formulation multiplied by light interception. Light interception is calculated via Beer's law with a constant light extinction coefficient operating on Leaf Area Index (LAI).

A parameter (GAMMA) determines the fraction of GPP that is autotrophic respiration. The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is then allocated to above and below-ground vegetation via a fixed allocation fraction. Carbon is lost from the plant pools to a single soil pool via fixed turnover rates. Heterotropic respiration in the soil is determined via a soil turnover rate.

The model equations are

-- Photosynthesis

\deqn{LAI = LAR*Cv}
\deqn{GPP = PAR * LUE * (1 - \exp^{(-KEXT * LAI)})}
\deqn{NPP = (1-GAMMA) * GPP}

-- State equations
\deqn{dCv/dt  = Av * NPP - Cv/tauV}
\deqn{dCr/dt  = (1.0-Av) * NPP - Cr/tauR}
\deqn{dCs/dt  = Cr/tauR + Cv/tauV - Cs/tauS}

The model time-step is daily.
